## Set-up

The project has only been tested on Windows, but might work in other systems with adjustments.

### Install Python Dependencies
The following Python dependencies need to be installed.

- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Pillow
- mkdir_p

### Get BizHawk (1.12.2)

Our scripts are all written for the BizHawk emulator (tested in version 1.12.2), which has embedded Lua scripting. To get BizHawk you first need to install the prerequisites - https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk-Prereqs/releases. Then you can download BizHawk and unzip it to any directory - https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/releases/
